# z_score_generator
uses numpy.random.randn() to generate a random number from a distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (a z-score, basically). It then keeps record on a txt file of the greatest z-score(a z-score with the lowest probability). The greatest z-score I have gotten so far is 6.323802311020854. Can you beat that?
